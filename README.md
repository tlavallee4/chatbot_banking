# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
- Trying to create new tests without copying the previous test was a bit of a challenge
- Accidentally updating the ACCOUNTS dictionary and it causing other tests to fail was an issue
- Making sure every letter, space, symbol is exactly equal from result to expected result was time consuming
## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
- Improving code quality and collaboration. It helps write testable, stable, and readable code.
- Shows what errors we can expect within the code and how it should and shouldn't function
- It's time consuming but good practice
